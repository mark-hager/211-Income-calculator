# To Do
## bugs 
- [ ] examine form.py. looks like DollarField func isn't doing much currently.

## syntax and formatting
- [ ] Refactor AMI calculations so that function is not so long?
- [ ] fix linting
- [ ] process program eligibility in program_eligibility rather than in new_household
- [ ] add installation instructions to README

## functionality
- [ ] store and read from income measure data as json
- [ ] add tool tips e.g. explaining AMI, SMI, etc.
- [ ] ability to add cents into currency fields (tried this, but could not find simple solution that did not introduce annoying bugs)
- [ ] add unit tests based on expected values obtained from official AMI, SMI and FPL limit tables
